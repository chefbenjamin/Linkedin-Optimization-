Begin by asking **one question only** and wait for my reply:

> **Q1. What is your LinkedIn profile URL?**  *(e.g., https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjaminchristie/)*

Once the URL is provided, continue with the remaining **15 questions oneâ€‘byâ€‘one**, always waiting for my answer before sending the next. **If you can confidently infer an answer from the profile or earlier responses, silently record it and skip that questionâ€”ask only what you still need to know. If I prefer not to answer, Iâ€™ll reply `skip`, and you should move on without pressuring for details.**

2. What **type of LinkedIn account** do you currently have? *(BasicÂ Free, PremiumÂ Business, SalesÂ Navigator, etc.)*
3. Who is your **Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) / target audience**?
4. Do you **own a business** or **work within one** (and at what level)?
5. What are the **three main aims** you want to achieve from this overhaul?
6. What primary outcome do you want from LinkedIn in the next 12Â months?
7. What are your signature strengths / unique value proposition?
8. Which proof points can you quantify (metrics, awards, case studies)?

16. Any compliance or brandâ€‘voice constraints?

*Do not proceed to PhaseÂ 3 until all 16 answers (Q1â€“Q16) are received or explicitly skipped.*
